title: The blog is dead. Long live the blog!
<!-- date: 2020-06-15 -->
excerpt: >-
    I want to have control of my information (that is my blog), but I'd be silly if I don't upload my posts to Medium or
    dev.to
    Here I'll explain the steps to set up github pages blog on your own custom domain with custom jekyll plugins, themes and 
    integrations, while being able to preview locally with docker. On a follow-up, I'll create some github actions to 
    push the content to Medium and dev.to as well as promote to Twitter and LinkedIn.
