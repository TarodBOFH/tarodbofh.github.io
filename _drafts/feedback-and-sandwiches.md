title: Feedback and Sandwiches

    I saw something at [Basecamp's "How we communicate"](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate) guide that
    made me think about the classic sandwich when delivering bad news/feedback, so I decided to share a feedback canvas
    that is working for me when trying to help teams to adopt a constructive feedback culture.

Yesterday somebody shared  [Basecamp's "How we communicate"](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate) guide in 
our corporate workplace. 
At the time of this post, it is [half a year old](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1213198779517681670) and I have 
seen it a couple of times during quarantine. However, this time around something caught my attention, something that 
made me think about writing this entry.

> Great news delivered on the heels of bad news makes both bits worse. 
> The bad news feels like it's being buried, the good news feels like it's being injected to change the mood. 
> Be honest with each by giving them adequate space.

Why did this statement trigger something in my head?

I am Spanish. Mediterranean, but I've worked in Netherlands, France, Bulgaria, San Francisco... I've caught
glimpses of other cultures. One of the soft skills I was able to improve while working in the US was giving and 
receiving feedback.

As part of a team-building exercise to build trust, we made confessions to coworkers. One of the techniques shared by 
the trainer was the _sandwich_. I've learned that it is a classic in American culture, and
once aware of it I was able to identify _the sandwich :sandwich:_ early on during conversations:

> Hey Juan! Can I say something personal to you? I've always appreciated you and your family!
> You need to lose some weight because your health is important, and it's a wonderful daughter you need to take care of!

That happened (not literally but almost!) during lunch with an American friend that visited a year ago (I'm 
improving my health, I promise :muscle: ). 
I saw the pattern immediately and let my friend know that I caught him in the _sandwich_ (we always laugh at our cultural 
differences) and he confirmed that it is in his DNA.

What's funny about it is, as Basecamp code says, everything is wrong with that technique. The first slice of bread 
seems artificial, and the _wonderful daughter_ seems to be there just to change the mood, burying the important thing, 
that is to lose weight or get healthier.

### Feedback Canvas

>When giving feedback, you should be constructive, specific and always assume good intent. 
>That goes in both directions: when you receive feedback, assume that the person who is giving you the feedback is 
>going beyond his comfort zone and is pro-actively trying to help you to grow further. 
>
>When you give feedback to someone else, please keep in mind that you donâ€™t know the full picture: assume that your 
>colleague was acting and performing to the best of his skills and knowledge and with good intent.
>
>All feedback must be specific. That is, you should name specific examples.
>
>Sometimes feedback is just one way conversation, and the receiving part will just receive and think about it.
>Other times it spawns a two-way conversation, creating actionable take-aways. 
>In this latter case, it is ok to recommend steps that your colleague can act upon. 
>Otherwise, let them come himself with actions and be ready to give him your opinion on them if applicable.

This is my canvas for feedback conversations, and it is the one I use in my 1:1s when nobody provides a different
framework.

After the intro, I have some questions to help drive the conversation:

- What are some things that you see me doing well and should continue doing?
- Is there anything I am not doing yet that you would want to see me start doing?
- Is there anything I am doing that you would want to see me stop doing?

The goal of the first question is to see if my efforts are aligned with what people perceive, while the second one is 
to see what might be in my blind spot but is obvious to others.

Usually, the most difficult question is the last one, but it's not sandwiched between the other ones. It's left at the
end on purpose; it is what pushes people outside their comfort zone.

In my experience, people still use sandwiches to avoid bringing negative stuff into a conversation, and that is ok. I am 
often told that I go too fast or that I intimidate people because I come across as self-confident, which makes them feel
insecure or worried about their own skills or capabilities (impostor syndrome).

What is funny is that those things don't appear on the third question, but instead during the first or second one.
I have found it very challenging to learn how to ask the right questions when I want to understand how I can be a better
person or coworker.

Of course the first two questions are important. Yet in the end, those negative points that we are often afraid of 
drawing attention to are the points that can spawn the spark of a change.
