Hi there! :wave:

It has been a really long long time since I first wanted to create my tech-blog. It all started around the early 
00s (yes, I' m that old...) but I had the feeling it was not going to have the right quality nor I had found the right 
medium (wink, wink :wink: ) to publish it.

So let's start about myself.

I was born in the end of the 70's in Spain. I think myself as a millennial (eat that!) since I am no generation-X, so I 
must be generation-Y.

I am a software engineer, and I have been since I was a teenager (actually, sooner than that).

My first computer was an [Amstrad CPC 464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC464) with an amazing and insane 
amount of ~~RAM~~ memory: 64Â KB.

I had been learning English since I was 6 (thanks Mom, thanks Dad) and I was given with it this thing that my parents 
thought it was the computer manual (unfortunately they did not know any english...).
It was titled *[40 Educational games for the Amstrad CPC 464](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/40_Educational_Games_for_the_Amstrad_CPC464)* 
and I was just 9 when I got my hands on it. 
You could create music, images, animations... but more important, you learned what was a variable, how the code was 
structured (actually, linear*ized* ...). It was really important in my development as it helped my brain to form the right 
neural connections to develop as a logic thinker and problem solver.

It was fun, I was a very organized kid, with my routines and my compulsive behavior... and I remember feeling kinda 
frustrated when I wrote my first app (how where they called back in the day? ... oh, *programs*), a db and a couple of 
screens to manage my book collection (that was plain basic, no kidding). My frustration came when I had *literally *no 
way to persistent store my information anywhere. I had to type everything (even the program) every time I wanted to 
*store* some book notes.

That is how it started. Now I am a senior software engineer, and I work mainly on back-end micro-services. I am learning 
`kotlin` and I'm loving it. A few years ago I left software engineering because I was bored, and I could not find 
*state of the art* companies in Spain, but I always loved technical challenges, so I switched back to engineering working 
with SF start-ups. It is really a pleasure working with the *valley* mindset and all the tools out there to improve
 our productivity.

What do I want with this blog? What I never did before: sharing my ideas, code snippets and get feedback from... 
anywhere in the world.

`hello world, here I come!`

Cheers to all,

Ping me if you come to Madrid and want to share a beer over a nice conversation.
